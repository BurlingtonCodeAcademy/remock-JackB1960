      <h3>Homecoming</h3>

      I woke but did not want to, from a dream where no one was at war with anyone, no one fleeing flood or
      famine.

      <p>It was a place with low human density, door gardens, grain fields, pastures and forest on nearby hills, and
        in the streams - plenty of fish.</p>
      <p>And everyone was at home.</p>
      <p>As dreams go, it felt a bit like a small Nebraska town, or might have been Syria or Honduras – some
        universal village anyway, with abundant contentment in the absence of too much progress.</p>
      <p>Kids played in the square till late, grandparents already sleeping.</p>
      <p>At night, you could hear neighbors, cough, argue, making love,</p>
      <p>and there was fresh bread in the morning – a short walk away.</p>

      <p>It never quite works though, dozing back, to recover, </p>
      <p>or edit such dreams. I wanted to shape this one, to conjure up the return</p>
      <p>to such places for all who have had to flee them,</p>
      <p>millions uprooting, bundling, leaving the elders
        - leaving all behind.</p>

      <p>those who paid scoundrels with family treasure, to take them</p>
      <p>in leaky boats, airless trucks, frigid train tops, force marched</p>
      <p>to hostile borders and foreign tongues, then to endure weeks or months</p>
      <p>under bridges or blue tarps, be trapped in canvas cities,</p>
      - waking from their own dreams of home.
      </p>
