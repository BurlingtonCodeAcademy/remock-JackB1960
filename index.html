    <p>“The time has come for science to busy itself with the earth itself. The first step is to reconstruct a sample of what we had to start with. That in a nutshell is the Arboretum.” <i>The Arboretum and the University, The River of the Mother of God</i>
    </p>
    <p>“Like winds and sunsets, wild things were taken for granted until progress began to do away with them. Now we
    face the question whether a still higher ‘standard of living’ is worth its cost in things natural, wild and
    free.”<i>Foreword, A Sand County Almanac.</i></p>

  // A work in progress, I'm thinking about using a table if I can't control how much goes into a grid 

  
    <div id="tableContainer"><p>“One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of
    wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen. An ecologist must either harden his
    shell and make believe that the consequences of science are none of his business, or he must be the doctor who
    sees the marks of death in a community that believes itself well and does not want to be told otherwise.”
      ― Aldo Leopold, A Sand County Almanac</p>
    <p>“Conservation is getting nowhere because it is incompatible with our Abrahamic concept of land. We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect.”
        ― Aldo Leopold</p>
