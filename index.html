    <p>“The time has come for science to busy itself with the earth itself. The first step is to reconstruct a
      sample of what we had to start with. That in a nutshell is the Arboretum.” <i>TheArboretum and the University, The
        River of the Mother of God</i>
    </p>
    <p>“Like winds and sunsets, wild things were taken for granted until progress began to do away with them.
      Now we face the question whether a still higher ‘standard of living’ is worth its cost in things natural, wild and
      free.”<i>Foreword, A Sand County Almanac.</i></p>

    <p>“One of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage
      inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen. An ecologist must either harden his shell and make believe that
      the consequences of science are none of his business, or he must be the doctor who sees the marks of death in a
      community that believes itself well and does not want to be told otherwise.” <i>Aldo Leopold, A Sand County
        Almanac</i> </p>
    <p>“Conservation is getting nowhere because it is incompatible with our Abrahamic concept of land. We abuse land
      because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may
      begin to use it with love and respect.” <i>Aldo Leopold</i></p>
    "Aldo Leopold was an American author, philosopher, naturalist, scientist, ecologist, forester,
    conservationist, and environmentalist. He was a professor at the University of Wisconsin and is best known for his
    book A Sand County Almanac, which has sold more than two million copies."

        <p> “I only went out for a walk and finally concluded to stay out till sundown, for going out, I found, was

        <p>The mountains are calling and I must go.</p>
        <p>In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.</p>
        <p>Climb the mountains and get their good tidings.</p>
        <p>When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.
        </p>

        <p>Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give
          strength
          to body and soul.</p>
        <p>Keep close to Nature’s heart... and break clear away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week
          in
          the woods. Wash your spirit
          clean.</p>



        <p>When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world.</p>

      <!-- A poem from a dear friend, he just won the cowboy poet award, a big thing out west -->
      <h3>Homecoming, Part One</h3>
      <p>I woke but did not want to, from a dream where no one was at war with anyone, no one fleeing flood or
        famine.It was a place with low human density, door gardens,
        grain fields, pastures and forest on nearby hills,
        and in the streams - plenty of fish.
        And Everyone was at home.</p>

      <p>As dreams go, it felt a bit like a small Nebraska town,</p>
      <p>or might have been Syria or Honduras – some universal village anyway,
        with abundant contentment in the absence of too much progress.
        Kids played in the square till late, grandparents already sleeping.
        At night, you could hear neighbors, cough, argue, making love,
        and there was fresh bread in the morning – a short walk away
      </p>
      <p> It never quite works though, dozing back, to recover,
        or edit such dreams. I wanted to shape this one, to conjure up the return
        to such places for all who have had to flee them,
        millions uprooting, bundling, leaving the elders
        - leaving all behind.
      </p>

      <i> George and Nancy Wallace, Larimer County, Colorado USA</i>

        bridges or blue tarps, be trapped in canvas cities,
        - waking from their own dreams of home.
