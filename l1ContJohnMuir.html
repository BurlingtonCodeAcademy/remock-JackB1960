        <p>The mountains are calling and I must go.</p>
        <p>In every walk with nature one receives far more than he seeks.</p>
        <p>Climb the mountains and get their good tidings.</p>
        <p>When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe.</p>

        <p>Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and
          give
          strength
          to body and soul.</p>
        <p>Keep close to Nature’s heart... and break clear away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a
          week
          in
          the woods. Wash your spirit
          clean.</p>

        <!-- and why not add a famous photo of conservationist -->

        <p>When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world.</p>

      <h2>Another GW Poem</h2>
      <h3>Spring Break</h3>
      <p>Spring Break
        The end of February was so bleak, brown, eaten down,
        beaten down, laid over, pressed flat, no apparent life
        loitering anywhere, even in the spaces we have left for it.
        Dirty November snowdrifts, glaciated, still lingering in windbreak shadows,
        the lone coyote crossing the still frozen lake searching for a boney turd or duck carcass.
        Blackbirds, Finches, Sparrows and Juncos resorting to feeders and pilfered hen-scratch.
      </p>
      <!-- A required  date box -->

      <p>Then comes word of a greasy pandemic slowly back-stroking in our direction!
        Gratefully, the five-syllable hoot of nested Great Horned Owls brings us back
        from a moment of depression.</p>
      <div id="dateBox">
        <p>July 4, 2020</p>
      </div>
      <p> The ever- lasting creation has its own agenda, its own direction in mind
        as March, calendar of cold wind and rain-snow mixes and blessed
        intermittent sun - finally begins to remind us.
        It starts as some celestial commander gives the order.
        “All geese must fall out of formation and pair up – huuup!” Hearing this,
        a forgivably heartless Bald Eagle heads for a tree-top perch
        looking for cripples that lack the protective cover of flock or mate.

      <p>
        A few days in, come squadrons of acrobatic Teal
        on green, blue and cinnamon wings - such daring stealthy fighter pilots.
        Soon thereafter, even the hard of hearing note the unmistakable deep, rasping, ancient
        call of Sandhill Cranes, heard before they are seen. One strains to see
        the long high formations moving North, sometimes circling elegantly
        to scout for feed, refuge, or like kind,
        - or perhaps just to slow dance, show off a little.
